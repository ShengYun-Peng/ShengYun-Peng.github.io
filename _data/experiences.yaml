  description: "We proposed a novel anchor free tracker, which represented an object by a single point at bounding box center,
  and other properties such as object size and local offsets were regressed directly from image features at the center location.
  I simulated operation fusion, network slicing, and data quantization for tracking network in PyTorch. We also worked on
  the deployment of trackers on FPGA boards with the assistance of an RTL based hand-coded FPGA overlay domain-specific processor unit (OPU)
  with software programmability and fast compilation time, targeting at general CNN accelerations."

  description: "I proposed a novel and complete framework which obtained the natural frequency
  and modes of vibration with a non-contact measurement method based on optical flow,
  correlation filter and Siamese network with single UAV. We measured the displacements of a five-storey structure
  and the errors of first order and the second order natural frequency were 0.09% and 1.01%, respectively.
  We also verified the accuracy through the first shaking table test of a full scale low-damage
  concrete wall building in the world at International Joint Research Laboratory of Earthquake Engineering,
  and the mean squared error of UAV camera and linear variable differential transformers was below 4%"
